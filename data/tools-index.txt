[GDrive-to-GSheet]
ToolName=01_GDrive-to-GSheet
Description=Drive-to-GSheet is Smart Indexing & Data Retention - offers precision scanning, letting you index specific folders or sub-folders into a Google Sheet. It's smart enough to preserve your custom columns (like 'Comments' and 'Tags') across runs by migrating them to the new index sheet, ensuring you never lose your manual classification work. The previous run is archived as SheetName_OLD, and a detailed Log tracks the process for complete confidence. Audit, tag, and organize your Drive without losing your progress.
Purpose=Scans Google Drive folders and generates structured GSheet inventory with metadata.
